    ".PMF: The PMF is a function that provides the probability of a discrete random variable taking on a specific value. It gives the probability for each possible outcome. For example, consider a fair six-sided die. The PMF would give you the probabilities of rolling each number from 1 to 6, and it would be a uniform distribution with each outcome having a probability of 1/6.\n",
    ".PDF: The PDF is a function that describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. It doesn't give the probability of specific values but rather the probability density at a particular point. For instance, in a standard normal distribution, the PDF tells you the likelihood of a random variable taking on a particular value, such as the probability density at the mean (0)."

This means that there is a 97.5% probability that a randomly selected observation from the standard normal distribution is less than or equal to 1.96. CDFs are useful for calculating probabilities and understanding the distribution's cumulative behavior."
